	* rtm.py: Issue a warnging if simplejson is not available.

	* rtm.py: Fixed a corner case where parsing the response with 
	  dottedJSON (i.e., when not using simplejson) would fail to
	  fetch multiple tags. Contributed by Greg Allen.

	* rtm.py: Implemented the full RTM API. Integrated simplejson to
	  handle JSON responses, which should fix some encoding problems.
	  Renamed some internal attributes (name, auth) of RTM class,
	  because they where conflicting with some methods and arguments
	  of the API calls wich had the same name. Fixed a minor issue
	  with dottedDict class and non dict instances. Added a simple
	  mechanism to turn debugging on/off dynamically.
	* README / ChangeLog: Added.
